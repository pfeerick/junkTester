# Word wrapping test

So I have a theory. This theory is that with markdown, that fixed line lengths
are actually ignored, and soft-wrapped still (on GitHub, at least). But there
is naturally only one way to check this... by writing some text and shoving it
onto github. So the prior lines are fixed length... probably around 60 chars.

But this is going to be one whopper of a line... not sure what I'll actually write in order to make it wrap the Github 'new file' editor once or twice, on a 24" monitor at with the editor open full screen, but it seems like I've probably rambled enough, as it's now about three times as long as the prior lines, so should do the trick. Lets see how it renders now!!!
